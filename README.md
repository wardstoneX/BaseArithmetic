# BaseArithmetic 

## Project Overview

**BaseArithmetic** provides a function **`void arith_op_any_base(int base, const char *alph, const char *z1, const char *z2, char op, char *result)`** designed to handle arithmetic operations in various numeral systems. The function takes two numbers (`z1` and `z2`), both represented in the specified base (`base`) and using the given alphabet (`alph`). It performs the specified arithmetic operation (`op`), which can be addition, subtraction, or multiplication, and writes the result to the `result` buffer.
